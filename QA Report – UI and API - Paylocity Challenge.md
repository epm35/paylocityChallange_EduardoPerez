## UI‚ÄìAPI Issues

### [Showstopper] First Name and Last Name are switched after adding an employee
- **Type:** UI‚ÄìAPI  
- **Severity:** Showstopper  
- **Description:** After adding an employee, the UI renders First Name and Last Name swapped, even though the API POST is correct.  
- **Expected:** After adding an employee, the table should display the `First Name` in the First Name column and the `Last Name` in the Last Name column, matching the values entered in the form.  
- **Actual:** The values for `First Name` and `Last Name` are swapped in the employees table. The `First Name` column shows the last name, and the `Last Name` column shows the first name  
- **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Log in with valid credentials.  
  2. Click the Add Employee button.  
  3. In the First Name field, enter `John`.  
  4. In the Last Name field, enter `Smith`.  
  5. Fill in the remaining required fields with valid data (e.g., `Dependents = 2`).  
  6. Click Add to save the employee.  
  7. Observe the employees table:  
     - The First Name column shows `Smith`.  
     - The Last Name column shows `John`.  
  - **Notes:**  
    - The swap happens in the UI rendering, the API Post is working as expected.

### [Medium] Inconsistent Spelling for "Dependents" Field
- **Type:** UI / API  
- **Severity:** Medium

- **Actual:** The UI (column header and Add Employee form) uses `Dependents` (US English), while the API schema property name is `dependants` (British English).  
- **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Open the Employees table in the UI.  
  2. Observe the column header for the dependents count, it reads "Dependents".  
  3. Click Add Employee and check the label for the dependents input, it also reads "Dependents".
